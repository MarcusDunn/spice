# spice
Spice your REPL with syntax highlighting.

## Goals
- [ ] zero overhead
- [ ] configurable syntax highlighting
- [ ] completly agnostist of the target REPL
- [ ] input to `spice [repl]` should behave the exact same as `[repl]`
- [ ] Auto detect all REPLs that are for a language supported by [syntect](https://github.com/trishume/syntect)
- [ ] allow people to still use this with configuration even if you launch `python` with `ghci`

THIS IS VERY WORK IN PROGRESS AT THE MOMENT. Hopefully within a couple weeks I'll *"offically"* release it after some cleanup and testing
